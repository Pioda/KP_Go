This article aims to compare the functional programming aspects of GOLang, which is currently maintained by Google, with Microsofts OCaml based functional programming language F#. It is written as a exam study paper, handed in and presented to fellow students and examiners as a fair and honest view on both programming languages.

== Functional programming
[quote, Eric Elliot]
____
Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects. paragraph.footnote:[https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0]
____
Functional programming heavily differs from object orientation in Java or C#. 

== GO programming language
=== General
The Golang programming language first got presented by Rob Pike at Google around 2009, with it's first stable release following three years later in 2012. It got created as a response to Javas or C++ inadequacies and suitability for scaling cloudcomputing services. As a programming language it builds on simplicity, safety, fast compilation and execution (i.e. _Gofast_), builtin concurrency and a toolchain that produces statically linked native binaries.

Heavily influenced by the programming language _C_, Go delivers procedural programming features, object orientation and functional programming.  
On the following pages this article will be focusing on the functional programming aspects.
