This article aims to compare the functional programming aspects of GOLang, which is currently maintained by Google, with Microsofts OCaml based functional programming language F#. It is written as a exam study paper, handed in and presented to fellow students and examiners as a fair and honest view on both programming languages.

== Functional programming
[quote, Eric Elliot]
____
Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects. paragraph.footnote:[https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0]

=== Basics of functional programming

Functional programming heavily differs from object orientation in Java or C#. As it is summarized in above statement, functional programming trades shared state in instantiated objects for the composition of pure functions. With functional programming the developer describes a set of functions that can be invoked when supplying certain input. The design of those is similiar to the concept of mathematical functions, which use conditionals and recursion to perform computation. Functional programming code tends to be more readable, easier to test and has a higher predicatbility than OO or procedural developed code. In compination with the missing shared state, it also tends to be less buggy, because without state there can't be sideffects from an inconsisten state. Newcomers originating from OO or procedural programming languages often struggle to get started with FP because of the mindset and common patterns associated with it which differ vastly from those in OOP for example.

FP languages can be divided into two segments:

* Pure Functional languages, which only support the functional paradgims (i.e. no state).
* Impure Functional languages, which grant the possibility to use other OO or procedural related concepts.

=== Functional languages ruleset

As with any programming paradigm, branding a certain ruleset on it is rather difficult. Over time some rules arose that FP languages and programmers __should__ follow to stick as close as possible to the paradigms paragraph.footnote:[https://thecodeboss.dev/2016/12/core-functional-programming-concepts/]

. Functions are pure, meaning that everytime the function gets called, with identical input, it produces the same output and does not inflict side effects (i.e. altering/creating state).
. Functions are first class and higher order. First class roughly means that a variable can be assigned a function. This in combination with 'higher order' imposes that functions can be arguments/input parameters to other functions.
. Variables should be immutable. Once a variable gets created and assigned, its value should never change again. Operations altering variable state should result in an assignment to a __new__ variable.
. Any function should be __referential transparent__. This means that any occurance of a call to a function __method(5)__ can be replaced with the returned value of said method without changing the programs behaviour and state. 

== GO programming language
=== General
The Golang programming language first got presented by Rob Pike at Google around 2009, with it's first stable release following three years later in 2012. It got created as a response to Javas or C++ inadequacies and suitability for scaling cloudcomputing services. As a programming language it builds on simplicity, safety, fast compilation and execution (i.e. _Gofast_), builtin concurrency and a toolchain that produces statically linked native binaries.

Heavily influenced by the programming language _C_, Go delivers procedural programming features, object orientation and functional programming.  
On the following pages this article will be focusing on the functional programming aspects. 

=== Functional Programming in GO
Since functional programming in __Go__ is neither the only nor the main aspect, it belongs to the **Impure Functional languages**. Further, it wasn't designed to be a functional programming language. This is easily spotted by the absence of builtin functions like 'Map', 'Filter' and 'Reduce'. To be fair, they can be easily implemented using Gos functional aspects but aren't part of the main framework. Being an impure functional language also means that it doesn't enforce the rules stated in <<Functional languages ruleset>>. For example it is perfectly fine in go to write following code:
[source, go]
----
name_string := "Daniel"
name_string := name_string + "Piotrowski"
----
For this to be more in line with the functional paradigms it should be rewritten in:
[source, go]
----
first_name := "Daniel"
last_name := "Piotrowski"
full_name := first_name + " " + last_name
----
In the first example the state of the __name_string__ variable changes multiple times where as in the second every variable is treated as immutable and therefor adherent to the FP paradigms.

==== First-class and higher-order
In Go every function can be stored into a variable and passed to a function as input. For example this can be used to create filter method for an array of integers.
[source, go]
----
func filter(input []int, filterFunction func(int) bool)(ret []int){
	for _, i := range input{
		if filterFunction(i){
			ret = append(ret, i)
		}
	}
	return
}
----
This function takes an array of integers and a function as input. Next it applies the input function on every index of the input array, if the condition returns true, it appends to the return array. With this we can create filter methods for even and odd numbers.
[source, go]
----
odd_func := func(i int) bool {return i%2 == 1}
even_func := func(i int) bool {return i%2 == 0}
----
With these two we can now filter an array in integers.
[source, go]
----
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	input := []int{1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
	odd_func := func(i int) bool {return i%2 == 1}
	even_func := func(i int) bool {return i%2 == 0}

	fmt.Println(filter(input, odd_func)) // returns [1 3 5 7]
	fmt.Println(filter(input, even_func)) // returns [2 4 6]
}

func filter(input []int, filterFunction func(int) bool)(ret []int){
	for _, i := range input{
		if filterFunction(i){
			ret = append(ret, i)
		}
	}
	return
}
----
As a side-note the __filter__ function is pure, as it does not depend on external/global state, references, etc. It only takes the inputs and creates something new (a new array) with them and returns it.

==== Recursion
Typically a pure FP language, like Haskell, favors recursion over looping. As Golang is an impure FP language, one can do an iterative or a recursive approach to solve loop-scenarios.
[source, go]
----
func fib_it(n int) int{
	a := 0
	b := 1
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		temp := a
        a = b
        b = temp + a
	}
	return a
}
----
In this code example we have calculated the n'th fibonacci number using a loop-iterative approach. For recursion, this can written down into:
[source, go]
----
func fib_rec(n int) int{
	if n == 0 || n == 1{
		return n
	} else{
		return fib_rec(n-1) + fib_rec(n-2)
	} 
}
----

==== Currying, Composition and Closure

A closure is a function (called parent-function) that takes input parameters and returns another function (called child-function). During the execution of the parent-function local state of variables can be bound into returned child-function. These bounded variables can be accessed to through the closures copies or references to the value. Golang supports the use of Closures:
[source, go]
----
func counter_closure(n int) func() int {
	counter:= 0
	return func() int{
		counter += n
		return counter
	}
}

counterIncrease3 := counter_closure(3) // counter is 0
counterIncrease3() // counter is 3
counterIncrease3() // counter is 6
----
Here the enclosing function and the anonymous return function share the local state of the variable __counter__, hence the __counterIncrease3__ method can be created to increase __counter__ by 3 every time it is called.

The technique of Currying is splitting a single function that takes a multiple number of arguments into multiple functions that take a single argument, but are called in sequence for computation. In Go it can be achieved simply by expanding the Closure return function to accept an additional parameter.
[source, go]
----
func add(n, i int) int {
    return n + i
}
func curried_add(n int) func(int) int {
	return func(i int) int{
		 return n + i
	}
}
add(5,3) // returns 8
curried_add(5)(3) // returns 8
----

Composition is the act of composing multiple functions into a single function with a single return value. With Closures and Currying this can be easily achieved.
[source, go]
----
func mult(a int) func(int) int{
	return func(i int) int{
		return a * i
	}
}
pow := func(i int) int {return mult(i)(i)} 
pow(3) // returns 9
